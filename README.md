# idle-farmer

a little farming simulator-like game where you can manage a small farm, entirely in your browser

## what actually is this

this is a little game I am making, becasue I wanna play farming simulator but its a bit slow and long and I don't have a lot of time to

this is also my attempt to learn some new tech, and go to SF with the Hack Club Neighborhood programme, so hopefully I stick at this for 100 hours+ and go to SF!

## how to play

I'm planning to deploy this on cloudflare pages/vercel/github pages so you can just play it from the link to the side of this repo

saving is manual and you'll get a base64-encoded save file to either save to your disk or copy as text and import the next time you want to play!


that's it! have fun!!
